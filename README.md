# Stochastic-Simulation

The file NHHP4 contains a mathematical review (written in greek) of the non-homogeneous Poisson Processes. This file was part of an academic team project during my postgraduate studies,
whih was presented to both faculty and students. In the final pages simulation results for different intensity functions are presented.

The second file contains R code regarding simulations of discrete and continuous Markov Chains for given transition and intensity matrices and number of steps (or time value in the continuous case). This was also part of the academic project.
